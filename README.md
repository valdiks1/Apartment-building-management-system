Hello, this is my coursework project **Apartment-building-management-system**.

## Requirements
In order for the project to work, you need a local server with **PHP** and **MySQL** installed. 

## Database Setup
To ensure the project works correctly, use the script in the `MyHome.sql` file, which will create the database structure. Additionally, you need to fill in the `connection.php` file with the correct details, specifically:
- Host
- Username
- Password
- Database name

These details are necessary for proper database connection.

## Admin Login
To log into the admin account, use the following credentials:
- **Login:** admin@gmail.com
- **Password:** admin

## Regular User
To test the regular user account, you need to register in the web application.

### Notes
- Please make sure your local environment supports **PHP** and **MySQL**.
- Double-check your database connection settings in `connection.php` before running the project.
